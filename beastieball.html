        <p>How Beastieball mixes athlete psychology and monster-taming - and how it rekindled my competitive spirit!
        </p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been a fan of the Pokémon franchise. Between the games, anime, TCG, merchandise and drawing my favourite Pokémon I've always found something uniquely fascinating about the designs, world and gameplay. Despite this, no official media ever quite gripped me the same was as <b>Pokémon Showdown</b>, a competitive battle simulator. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>From school lunch breaks to after homework and even while at university, I was constantly involved in competitive gameplay of all kinds. When I started with school friends, I was always the weakest link. With practice I started to improve rapidly from teambuilding to turn-after-turn predictions on my opponents. Eventually I started to reach the upper echelons of play. Particularly when I started university, I was known for being brutally efficient with my matches. Matches were easy. Too easy. Over time, playing for the joy of the game was superceded by the joy of winning. By the time I had people who could give me a run for my money, I wasn't interested in competitive play anymore.</p>
		<br/>
        <p>Enter Beastieball. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Each player has only 45 seconds to take their turns, which reflects the fast-paced decision making processes with real athletes in physical sports. </p>
		<p>When a beastie loses all of its stamina, it has to stay on the bench for a few turns in order to recover. However, they will become sweaty which deals damage over time. Allowing beasties to revive should slow the game down, but in reality the tempo is drastically increased. As soon as the first point is taken from a wipe out, aggressive teams are racing against the clock to take the remaining points before the opposing defensive threats come back online. This gives the game a satisfying push-and-pull where </p>
